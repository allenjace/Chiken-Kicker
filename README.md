## Project Description
**Chicken Kicker** is a top-down arcade-style game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**. The objective of the game is to kick chickens off the stage. However, your movement and actions are determined by cards that are dealt to you randomly. As the game progresses, the pace quickens, and you can play cards faster, increasing the challenge and fun.
